            <div class="section-title">Personal Life:</div>
            <p>Hardik was born to Himanshu Pandya and Nalini Pandya. His father ran a small business and later moved the family to Baroda to support Hardik and his brother Krunal’s cricketing careers. Hardik left school after 9th grade and trained under Kiran More.

            <div class="sub-section-title">IPL:</div>
            <p>
                Hardik made his IPL debut in 2015 for Mumbai Indians. He impressed with quick-fire innings and brilliant fielding.  
                Over the years, he became one of Mumbai’s key finishers and won several titles with the team.  
                He played a vital role in their title wins in 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020.  
                His finishing ability and explosive power made him one of the most feared lower-order batters.  
                In 2022, he was appointed captain of the new franchise Gujarat Titans.  
                Under his captaincy, GT won the IPL in their debut season — a historic achievement.  
                Hardik led from the front, performing with both bat and ball.  
                He scored crucial runs and bowled in powerplays and death overs.  
                In the 2022 final, he was named Player of the Match.  
                In 2023, GT reached the final again but finished as runners-up.  
                His calm leadership and aggressive intent earned wide praise.  
                Hardik is now considered one of the top captains in the IPL.  
                His total IPL journey reflects maturity, leadership, and consistency.  
                He is also known for backing young talent and building team morale.  
                From a young power-hitter to a title-winning captain, his IPL career has been exceptional.
            </p>

            <div class="sub-section-title">ODIs:</div>
            <p>
                Hardik made his ODI debut in October 2016 against New Zealand.  
                He immediately impressed with his pace bowling and fearless batting.  
                Known for his finishing ability, he became India's designated No. 6/7 batter.  
                His batting strike rate in ODIs is among the highest for Indian all-rounders.  
                He has contributed in multiple series wins with both bat and ball.  
                His ability to provide breakthroughs with the ball in middle overs is valuable.  
                Hardik has played match-winning innings against teams like Australia and England.  
                He often balances the team by offering a proper fifth bowling option.  
                Despite injuries, he continues to be a first-choice pick in ODIs.  
                He was part of India’s squad in the 2019 World Cup and performed well.  
                In 2023, he began the tournament strongly but was ruled out due to injury.  
                His absence was felt in the knockout stages of the 2023 World Cup.  
                Hardik has also served as vice-captain in ODIs under Rohit Sharma.  
                His maturity, balance, and versatility are crucial in the ODI format.  
                He is expected to play a major role in India’s future ODI campaigns.
            </p>

            <div class="sub-section-title">Test Matches:</div>
            <p>
                Hardik debuted in Tests in July 2017 against Sri Lanka.  
                In just his third Test, he scored a century — 108 off 96 balls.  
                He became the first Indian to score a century before lunch on Day 2.  
                His fearless batting style added a new dimension to India’s Test middle order.  
                With the ball, he took five wickets in a match at Trent Bridge in 2018.  
                His swing and bounce made him effective in seamer-friendly conditions.  
                Despite the potential, injuries limited his red-ball appearances.  
                He played 11 Tests, scoring 532 runs and taking 17 wickets.  
                His fitness management became a concern for long formats.  
                After 2018, he was not selected for Tests to manage workload.  
                His Test career remains promising but paused due to injuries.  
                Many fans hope he returns to Tests in future, fully fit.  
                He filled a rare role of pace-bowling all-rounder in India’s Test setup.  
                His brief Test career showed signs of great all-round value.  
                A fit Hardik could again be a key part of India’s future Test plans.
            </p>

            <div class="sub-section-title">T20Is:</div>
            <p>
                Hardik made his T20I debut in January 2016 vs Australia.  
                He quickly became known for his six-hitting ability in the death overs.  
                His powerful shots and confident finishes earned him a regular spot.  
                With the ball, he bowled in powerplays and crucial end overs.  
                He has taken many key wickets in T20Is, including in Asia Cups.  
                Hardik has represented India in multiple T20 World Cups.  
                In 2022, he had a strong World Cup with both bat and ball.  
                He often anchors one end while accelerating in the final overs.  
                In 2022, he was made India’s stand-in T20I captain.  
                He led India to wins over Ireland, New Zealand, and Sri Lanka.  
                His calm leadership and clear tactics were praised.  
                Hardik is now seen as a likely future full-time T20 captain.  
                His presence provides balance, depth, and aggression to the lineup.  
                He remains a key player in India’s T20 squad for upcoming tournaments.  
                His T20 career reflects consistency, leadership, and match-winning impact.
            </p>

            <div class="sub-section-title">World Cup:</div>
            <p>
                Hardik played his first ICC World Cup in 2019 in England.  
                He played all games and contributed with both bat and ball.  
                He scored quick runs and took 10 wickets in the tournament.  
                His spell against Pakistan was especially impactful.  
                In the 2019 semi-final vs New Zealand, he took important wickets.  
                His performance was seen as vital in India’s strong campaign.  
                He was again selected for the 2023 World Cup in India.  
                He started the tournament well with strong all-round displays.  
                Unfortunately, he was injured midway through the event.  
                He missed the crucial knockout matches due to the injury.  
                India lost the final to Australia, and his absence was felt.  
                Hardik remains an important part of India’s World Cup plans.  
                His ability to finish innings and bowl in all phases is rare.  
                If fit, he will be crucial in future ICC tournaments.  
                His World Cup journey so far shows potential and strong contributions.
